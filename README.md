# 🚀 Intelligent Controller Design Using Reinforcement Learning
### 📚 MCTA 4362 Machine Learning — Mini Project
Project Title:
Design of Intelligent Controllers Using Reinforcement Learning for Control Applications

### 🎯  Project Overview
This project explores the design and implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller for a dynamic system, and compares its performance with classical control strategies such as Proportional (P), Proportional-Integral (PI), and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers.

## 🧠 Motivation
Classical controllers, while effective in linear systems, struggle with nonlinearity and unpredictable disturbances. RL offers a promising alternative by learning control policies from direct interaction with the environment.
